Shiny:
  - user uses sidebar to fill in date, etc.
  - user clicks 'go' button
  - result: Github api writes a new commit to github that is a JSON file with the stuff the user selected

Github:
 - receives a gh push of the JSON file
 - has an 'action' that automatically runs the scraper, which first reads the JSON info
 - output is a dataframe/list of lists/whatever
 - output is pushed to github
 
 Shiny:
  - reads the dataframe from github and displays it as a reactable or whatever
